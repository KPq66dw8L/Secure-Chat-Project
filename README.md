# Concept
A WIP secured - decentralized - messaging application or *chat*. 
The security aspect is managed through End-to-End encryption, while the decentralization is currently achieved via a Peer-to-Peer (P2P) network, with potential future implementation of a Blockchain-based system.

This project is developed using the TDD methodology.
